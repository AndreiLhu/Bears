      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified
        as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Bears are found on the continents
        of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common
        characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs,
        long snouts; small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five
        nonretractile claws, and short tails.

      <p>
        Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur;
        they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment,
        such as being made to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they
        play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects
        of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under
        pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in
        bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market.
